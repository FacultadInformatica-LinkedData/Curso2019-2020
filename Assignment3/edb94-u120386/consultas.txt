WHERE {
?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician> .
?x ?properties ?y .
}

2. Get all the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied to instances of the Politician class

SELECT DISTINCT ?properties
WHERE {
?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician> .
?x ?properties ?y .
FILTER (?properties != rdf:type)
}
	
3. Which different values exist for the properties, except rdf:type, of the instances of the Politician class?

SELECT DISTINCT ?properties ?values
WHERE {
?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician> .
?x ?properties ?y .
FILTER (?properties != rdf:type)
}
	
4. For each of the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied to instances of the Politician class, which different values do they take in those instances?

SELECT DISTINCT ?properties ?x ?y 
WHERE {
?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician> .
?x ?properties ?y
FILTER (?properties != rdf:type)
}

5. For each of the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied to instances of the Politician class, how many distinct values do they take in those instances?

SELECT DISTINCT ?properties count(distinct ?x) 
WHERE {
?z a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician> .
?z ?properties ?x
FILTER (?properties != rdf:type)
}
