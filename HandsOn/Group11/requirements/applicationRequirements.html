<p align= "center">SMART CITY : ALCOBENDAS</p>
- This dataset can be used in an application for Alcobendas's habitants or visitors, in which the app locates the person that is using it and they could see the fuel stations that are near them.</br>
- We are going to implement an opcion in the app where people can see the different prieces of the fuel in the different fuel stations, and this information has to be updated.</br>
- We are going to implement (if it is possible) an option in the app that says to the person that is using it the fuel stations which are open at the moment.</br>
- The app is going to have a map where the fuel stations are represented and the ability to click in one of them and see the information of that fuel station.</br>
