##Comments on the self-assessment##

One difficulty was find all the csv files with open license and with coordenates or some type of location that we can linked with the others files to create a linked data well formed.

Find csv files with documentation. However, we can find easly the same files in differents source of data (web pages).

We orginze the task by individuals sub tasks, first each one find a csv file, then we create the HTML files and each one fill the document with us opinion.
