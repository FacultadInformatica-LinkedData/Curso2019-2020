  <h1>Evaluation of the satisfaction of requirements for our datasets.</h1>
  <h3>R1. Data are in one of the selected smart city domains.</h3>
  <p>Our data comes primarily from Madrid's open data portal, which can be found <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/">here</a>. We have also included datasets from other sources with the goal of having more data available so as to have more flexibility in the design and capabilities of our app.</p>
  <h3>R2. Data are available as a CSV file.</h3>
  <p>All our data is in CSV format and was available in CSV from its sources.</p>
  <h3>R3. Data have an open license so they can be published.</h3>
  <p>All our data has an open license which requires the original pusblisher to be cited along with the date of download of the data, without stating or implying any endorsment of the use of the data from the publisher. The license can be found <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.3efdb29b813ad8241e830cc2a8a409a0/?vgnextoid=108804d4aab90410VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=b4c412b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default">here</a>.</p>
  <h3>R4. Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities (e.g., locations).</h3>
  <p>Some of our data relates to real world locations like museums and monuments, and some other is about events taking place at those locations, so we believe it satisfies the requirement.</p>
  <h3>R5. Documentation exists for the data (optional).</h3>
  <p>All our datasets have documentation associated to them. An example can be found <a href= "https://datos.madrid.es/FWProjects/egob/Catalogo/XComun/Ficheros/Estructura_conjunto_datos_www%20madrid%20es_v7%20(1).pdf">here</a>.</p>
  <h3>R6. Data can come from multiple data sources (optional). </h3>
  <p>Even though most of our data comes from the open data portal of the city of Madrid, we have gathered related data from other sources as well like <a href="https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/EsriSM::eventos-de-madrid/data?geometry=-3.919%2C40.340%2C-3.439%2C40.522"> this one</a> related to sports events in Madrid.</p>
